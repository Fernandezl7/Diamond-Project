Diamond Prices Comparative Analysis: Comparing various prediction models 
## Applying a trained model to predict diamond prices using the diamond dataset. Then, proceed to conduct a comparativbe analysis between the predicted prices and the actual prices for the diamonds in the dataset, to identify how accurate the predictive model is. 
Build and evaluate performance of linear regression, kNN (figure out optimal k), boosted tree, random forest and xgboost models for diamond price prediction. Report mean absolute error, RMSE, maximum error for each model.
